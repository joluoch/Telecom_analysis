# Telecom_analysis
this project is part of a training by @10acadmy and it was about customer segmentation in the telecommunication industries 
Customer Segmentation is the subdivision of a market into discrete customer groups that share similar characteristics. Customer Segmentation can be a powerful means to identify unsatisfied customer needs. Using the above data companies can then outperform the competition by developing uniquely appealing products and services.
we clustered customers based on their engaegement and their experence with the network using 
●	Average TCP retransmission
●	Average RTT
●	Handset type
●	Average throughput
as the expereince metrics and 
●	sessions frequency 
●	the duration of the session 
●	the sessions total traffic (download and upload (bytes))
 as the engagement metrics
